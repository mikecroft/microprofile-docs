==  microprofile-docs
 
The Microprofile project has several sources of information and collaboration. Since there is a large volume of activity, there is a need for important decisions to be recorded in one place for future reference. This is the aim of this repository.

=== Current Resources
The Microprofile project is community-focused at its heart and aims to engage and encourage lively discussion through as many channels as possible.

===== Google Group
The link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/microprofile[Microprofile Google Group] is the preferred place for discussions to take place.

===== Microprofile.io
There is a static website set up at link:http://microprofile.io[] which has a small FAQ along with a breif introduction to the project. It is not currently intended to be an exhaustive source of documentation for the project.

=== Notable Persons Involved
There is a very large number of people involved already at this early stage of the project. The following is a list of contributors from vendors as well as individuals which have given significant input to the project.
